The platform has been imported in the platform directory.  

Here is the list of things to implement : 


* The platform must be put online using Github actions. Be careful of the secrets. Write a secrets-install.md to explain to the user how to put them in producton. 
* The storage is on Firebase, it is partially implemented. Look at both frontend backend and platform implementations to unify them. Write a file  Firebase.md that keeps the data schema.   
* The Locrits from the server can be pushed to the platform.
* The platform allows to review conversations. 
* A big feature of the platform is creation 2 minutes (configurable) conversations between selected Locrits. A user set a topic and read the conversations between the Locrits. 


Locrit to Locrit conversations are handled by the public Locrit URL. It is a future feature.
